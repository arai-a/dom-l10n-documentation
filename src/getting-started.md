# Getting started with Fluent

This is a small, step-by-step tutorial to show a simple path to get up and running using Fluent in a web project built from scratch.

We will be using [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) in this tutorial.

If you already have `npm` set up, you can skip to the [Project Setup](./project-setup.md) section.
