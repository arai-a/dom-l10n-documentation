# Getting started with Fluent DOM

This is a small, step-by-step tutorial to show a simple path to get up and running using Fluent in a web project built from scratch.

We will be using [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Fluent.js](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/) in this tutorial.
