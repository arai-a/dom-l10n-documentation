# Fluent DOM

Fluent DOM is an abstraction that is specialized for localizing the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) (DOM).

There are two primary concepts to understand when working with Fluent DOM:

> [L10n ID](./l10n-id.md) — The identifiers by which Fluent DOM will recognize elements to localize.

> [L10n Args](./l10n-args.md) — The arguments that may be passed into the localized content to affect the final translation.
